# 💖 Life Analytics Tracker – Python + Data Visualization

Ever wondered where all your time goes?  
This project helps track, analyze, and visualize how you spend your day — powered by Python, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`.

## 🎯 What It Does

✅ Logs your activities with timestamp and duration  
✅ Stores the data in a structured `CSV` file  
✅ Analyzes it using `pandas`  
✅ Generates insightful **bar & pie charts**  
✅ Alerts you if your screen time (e.g. scrolling) exceeds 2 hours  
✅ Prints your most time-consuming activity of the day

## 💡 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- `pandas` – for data manipulation  
- `matplotlib` – for visualizations  
- `colorama` – for colorful CLI output
